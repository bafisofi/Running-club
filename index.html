              <p>
                Join us for voluntary practice sessions Mon-Fri at 6:30 PM at
                Serenity Gardens Park. We send out weekly emails with the
                practice schedule. During weekends, we participate in a diverse
                range of races throughout the year. These events provide us with
                opportunities to compete against other running clubs, fostering
                a spirit of friendly competition and camaraderie.

              <h3>What Sets Us Apart</h3>
              <p>
                In addition to training and racing, we organize various social
                events throughout the year. Previous events have included
                dinners, the Sweet Mile, baking contests, ice skating, camps and
                picnics. Enjoy the freedom to choose your own path: There are no
                coaches, no obligatory attendance, no forced competitions, and
                no prescribed workouts. Participate in races on your terms.
